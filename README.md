# HTML-Refactor-Challenge

## Description

The project here was to refactor the existing code to meet certain standards for ease of accessibility and CSS/HTML semantics. The codebase needs to follow accessibility standards so that when tools used to help with reading images, don't just state 'image'. We have implemented more specific information to describe what he image is. Additionally, making the correct adjustments in semantics for ease of others who come in after us. Making a ease to read/understand code, makes it easier for any future changes. CSS code was updated by removing excessive use of multiple classes, when one class would suffice. 

## Usage

The following images show the updated web application and the slight changes to the appearance to follow a more sequential order. 

Previously - the site would show 'Search Engine' before 'Online Reputation'. Here we can see that this was flipped to be more inline with alphabetical sequence. The same goes for the side bar, 'Lead Generation' was moved to the bottom for alphbetical sequence. 

The navigation bar at the top right of the page did not have a working 'Search Engine Optimization', this has been updated to correctly take the the viewer to the correct spot in the page.
