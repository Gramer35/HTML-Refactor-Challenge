# HTML-Refactor-Challenge

## Description

The project here was to refactor the existing code to meet certain standards for ease of accessibility and CSS/HTML semantics. The codebase needs to follow accessibility standards so it becomes more optimized for search engines. Additionally, making the correct adjustments in semantics for ease of others who come in after us. Making a ease to read/understand code, makes it easier for any future changes. CSS code was updated by removing excessive use of multiple classes, when one class would suffice. 

## Usage

The following images show the updated web application and the slight changes to the appearance to follow a more sequential order. 



    ```md
    !(assets/images/screenshot1.png)
    ```
    ```md
    !(assets/images/screenshot2.png)
    ```

Previously - the site would show 'Search Engine' before 'Online Reputation'. Here we can see that this was flipped to be more inline with alphabetical sequence. The same goes for the side bar, 'Lead Generation' was moved to the bottom for alphbetical sequence. 

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
