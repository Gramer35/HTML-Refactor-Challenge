# HTML-Refactor-Challenge

## Description

The project here was to refactor the existing code to meet certain standards for ease of accessibility and CSS/HTML semantics. The codebase needs to follow accessibility standards so it becomes more optimized for search engines. Additionally, making the correct adjustments in semantics for ease of others who come in after us. Making a ease to read/understand code, makes it easier for any future changes.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
